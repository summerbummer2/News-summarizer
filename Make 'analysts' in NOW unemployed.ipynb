- China on Saturday (June 20) confirmed the setting up of an agency in Hong Kong to oversee the implementation of a national security law as the country’s top lawmaking body released details about the

suggestions on major strategies and important policies for maintaining the national security; to supervise, guide, coordinate, and support the implementation of the maintenance of the national security of (Hong Kong); collect and analyse national security intelligence information; handle crimes against national security according to law,” the draft said.\nBut the agency will be separate from a dedicated unit the police will establish to deal with national security offences.\nThis is similar to what Macau introduced in 2018 after having passed a national security law nearly 10 years before.\nFurther feedback sessions have been held in the Chinese capital and in Shenzhen, the mainland city bordering Hong
